  **Design Movement**: Celestial Etherealism (天体エーテル主義)
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Weightlessness**: Elements should feel like they are floating in zero gravity.
  2. **Luminescence**: Light should emerge from darkness, guiding the user's eye.
  3. **Sacred Geometry**: Use geometric patterns to imply order within chaos.
  4. **Deep Immersion**: The interface should feel like entering a sanctuary, not just visiting a website.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Deep Void Blue (#050510)**: Represents the infinite universe and the unknown.
  - **Starlight Gold (#F4E7D3)**: Represents wisdom, guidance, and divine intervention.
  - **Nebula Purple (#6B4C9A)**: Represents mystery, intuition, and the subconscious.
  - **Ethereal Teal (#4FD1C5)**: Accents for healing and clarity.
  *Reasoning*: To evoke the feeling of looking up at the night sky, seeking answers from the stars.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Orbital Layout**: Content orbits around a central focal point (the user or the current oracle).
  - **Asymmetric Balance**: Avoid rigid grids; use fluid, organic placement of elements.
  - **Parallax Depth**: Layers of stars and nebulae moving at different speeds to create 3D depth.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Constellation Connectors**: Lines connecting interactive elements like stars in a constellation.
  - **Glowing Halos**: Soft, pulsing glows around active elements (buttons, avatars).
  - **Glassmorphism Cards**: Translucent panels that blur the background, feeling like floating crystal tablets.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Slow & Deliberate**: Animations should be slow and smooth, mimicking the movement of celestial bodies.
  - **Hover Reveals**: Information reveals itself gently upon interaction, like a star brightening.

  **Animation**:
  - **Twinkling Background**: Subtle, randomized opacity changes for background stars.
  - **Fade & Float**: Elements enter with a gentle fade and upward float.
  - **Orbiting Transitions**: Page transitions involve a circular, orbital motion.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Cinzel* or *Cormorant Garamond* (Elegant, serif, timeless).
  - **Body**: *Lato* or *Quicksand* (Clean, geometric, readable but soft).
  - **Hierarchy**: Large, tracking-wide headings for impact; delicate, readable body text.

  **Design Movement**: Cyber-Mysticism (サイバー神秘主義)
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Digital Ritual**: The act of using the app should feel like performing a digital spell.
  2. **Glitch & Divination**: Embrace controlled glitches as signs of spiritual communication.
  3. **Data as Magic**: Visualize data streams as magical energy flows.
  4. **High Contrast**: Stark contrast between the digital void and the data light.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Obsidian Black (#000000)**: The absolute void.
  - **Neon Cyan (#00FFFF)**: The flow of information and spirit.
  - **Hot Pink (#FF00FF)**: Passion, emotion, and urgent messages.
  - **Matrix Green (#00FF00)**: The underlying code of reality.
  *Reasoning*: To frame AI divination as a modern form of magic, merging ancient wisdom with future tech.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Terminal/HUD Interface**: Layouts resembling a futuristic heads-up display or a scrying mirror.
  - **Modular Grids**: Strict, visible grid lines that occasionally break or distort.
  - **Split Screen**: Duality between the user's input and the AI's output.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Scanlines & Noise**: Subtle CRT effects or digital noise overlays.
  - **Hexagonal Frames**: Portraits and icons framed in hexagons (nature's perfect shape + tech).
  - **Code Runes**: Decorative elements that look like a mix of programming code and ancient runes.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Instant & Sharp**: Interactions are snappy, with digital sound effects (haptic feedback).
  - **Typing Effects**: Text appears character by character, like a terminal or spirit writing.

  **Animation**:
  - **Glitch Reveal**: Elements appear with a brief chromatic aberration glitch.
  - **Data Stream**: Backgrounds feature flowing lines of code or symbols.
  - **Blink Cursor**: Prominent blinking cursors to invite input.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Orbitron* or *Rajdhani* (Futuristic, tech-inspired).
  - **Body**: *Share Tech Mono* or *Roboto Mono* (Monospaced, terminal-like).
  - **Hierarchy**: Uppercase, spaced-out headings; dense, code-like body text.

  **Design Movement**: Organic Alchemy (有機的錬金術)
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Natural Flow**: Mimic the flow of water, ink, and smoke.
  2. **Paper & Ink**: Textures that feel like ancient parchment or handmade paper.
  3. **Transmutation**: Visuals that change state (solid to liquid, dark to light).
  4. **Hand-Drawn Warmth**: Imperfect lines and organic shapes to counter AI coldness.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Parchment Beige (#F0E6D2)**: Warm, inviting, historical base.
  - **Ink Black (#2C2C2C)**: Soft black for text and ink illustrations.
  - **Crimson Seal (#8A1C1C)**: Accents representing life force and official seals.
  - **Gold Leaf (#D4AF37)**: Highlights for precious insights.
  *Reasoning*: To ground the AI experience in the tactile, human tradition of tarot and manuscript reading.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Scroll Layout**: Continuous vertical flow, like unrolling a scroll.
  - **Overlapping Layers**: Elements stack like papers on a desk.
  - **Centered Focus**: Main content is always centered, like a sacred text.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Ink Spills**: Decorative background elements resembling watercolor or ink washes.
  - **Wax Seals**: Buttons or badges styled like wax seals.
  - **Serif Borders**: Elegant, classical borders around cards and sections.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Fluid & Viscous**: Interactions feel like moving through water or ink.
  - **Paper Fold**: Transitions that look like turning a page or unfolding a letter.

  **Animation**:
  - **Ink Bleed**: Images and text reveal as if ink is soaking into paper.
  - **Floating Particles**: Dust motes or gold flakes drifting in the background.
  - **Hand-Drawn Wiggle**: Subtle vibration on lines to simulate hand-drawn animation.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Playfair Display* or *Cinzel Decorative* (High contrast, editorial).
  - **Body**: *EB Garamond* or *Crimson Text* (Old-style serif, highly readable).
  - **Hierarchy**: Large, italicized pull quotes; structured, book-like body text.

## Selected Approach
**Design Movement**: Celestial Etherealism (天体エーテル主義)

**Reasoning**: This style best matches the "Six Oracle" theme (Six Gods/Stars). It provides a mystical, premium feel suitable for a subscription service, balancing the "AI" aspect (modern, clean) with the "Divination" aspect (mysterious, spiritual). It avoids the coldness of pure tech (Cyber-Mysticism) and the potential datedness of pure tradition (Organic Alchemy).

**Implementation Plan**:
- **Background**: Deep gradient from black to midnight blue, with a particle system for stars.
- **Colors**: Gold and purple gradients for the "magical" feel, white/light gray for readability.
- **Fonts**: *Cinzel* for titles (mystical, authoritative), *Lato* for body (clean, modern).
- **UI Components**: Glassmorphism (frosted glass) for cards and modals to maintain the "floating" feel.
